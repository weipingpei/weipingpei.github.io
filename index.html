    <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>I am Weiping Pei, an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://engineering.utulsa.edu/cyber-studies/">School of Cyber Studies at The University of Tulsa</a>.
    I received my Ph.D degree in 2022 from <a href="https://cs.mines.edu/">Computer Science Department at the Colorado School of Mines</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://inside.mines.edu/~chuanyue/">Chuan Yue</a>. Before that, I got my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from Sun Yat-sen University. 
    My research interests are broadly in the area of security and privacy, crowdsourcing, and machine learning.
    </p>   
	    
    <b>I'm looking for self-motivated students (RA/TA support for both undergraduates and graduates) who are interested in doing research in security and privacy areas. Feel free to contact me.</b>
